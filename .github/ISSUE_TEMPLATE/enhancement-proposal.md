## Summary

<!--
A 1-2 paragraph "elevator pitch" of the enhancement. It should be understandable
to someone familiar with UCP but not necessarily the deep technical details of
this specific proposal.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
Explain the problem this proposal solves. Why is this significant change
necessary now? What use cases does it enable? Who is the target user or
beneficiary of this change?
-->

### Goals

<!--
List the specific, measurable outcomes of this enhancement.
-->
*
*

### Non-Goals

<!--
Explicitly state what is out of scope for this proposal. This helps focus the
discussion and prevents scope creep.
-->
*
*

## Detailed Design

<!--
This is the core of the proposal. Describe the architecture and implementation
details with enough clarity that another contributor could write the code based
on this description. Include sub-sections as needed, such as:

* **API Changes:** Detail any new API endpoints, changes to existing ones, or
  modifications to request/response schemas.
* **Data Structures:** Describe any changes to core data structures or JSON
  schemas.
* **Behavioral Changes:** Explain how the system's fundamental behavior will
  change.
-->

## Risks and Mitigations

<!--
This is a mandatory section. Discuss the potential downsides and risks of this
proposal. For every risk identified, list a mitigation strategy.

* **Security:** Does this introduce new attack vectors or data exposure risks?
* **Performance:** Will this negatively impact latency or throughput?
* **Backward Compatibility:** Will this break existing clients or workflows? If
  so, what is the migration plan?
* **Complexity:** Does this add significant maintenance burden to the protocol?
-->

## Test Plan

<!--
Describe how this feature will be tested. A test plan is required for a proposal
to be moved to the "Implementable" stage.

* **Unit Tests:** Which core logic requires unit coverage?
* **Integration Tests:** How will interactions between different components be
  verified?
* **End-to-End Tests:** What user scenarios will be automated to validate the
  full workflow?
-->

## Graduation Criteria

<!--
Define the specific, objective criteria required to move this feature through
the stability levels.

**Alpha -> Beta:**
* [ ] Feature is implemented behind a feature flag (if applicable).
* [ ] Unit and integration tests are passing.
* [ ] Initial documentation is written.
* [ ] Deployed and tested in a non-production environment.

**Beta -> General Availability (GA):**
* [ ] At least two independent implementations exist (e.g., from two different
      merchants or platforms).
* [ ] User/developer adoption feedback has been collected and addressed.
* [ ] No critical bugs have been reported for a set period (e.g., 4 weeks).
* [ ] Full documentation and migration guides are published.
-->

### Implementation History

<!--
This section will be updated by the maintainers as the proposal moves through
its lifecycle.

* [YYYY-MM-DD]: Proposal submitted as "Provisional".
* [YYYY-MM-DD]: TC approved proposal to move to "Implementable".
* [YYYY-MM-DD]: Code merged, proposal moved to "Implemented".
