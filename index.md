## Built for flexibility, security, and scale

Agentic commerce requires interoperability. UCP is built on industry standards — REST and JSON-RPC transports; [Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)](https://ap2-protocol.org/), [Agent2Agent (A2A)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/), and [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) support built-in — so different systems can work together without custom integration.

### Scalable and universal

Surface-agnostic design that scales to support any business (from small to enterprise), in every industry, across all modalities, including chat, visual commerce, and voice.

### Businesses at the center

Built to facilitate commerce, ensuring businesses retain control and remain the Merchant of Record, with full ownership of customer relationships.

### Open and extensible

Open and extensible by design, enabling development of community-driven capabilities and extensions across industries.

### Secure and private

Built on proven security standards for account linking (OAuth 2.0) and secure payment (AP2) via payment mandates and verifiable credentials.

### Frictionless payments

Open wallet ecosystem with interoperability between providers, ensuring buyers can use their preferred payment methods.

## See it in action

UCP is designed to facilitate the entire commerce lifecycle, from discovery and search to final sale and post-purchase support. The protocol supports a range of core capabilities, including: Catalog Search and Lookup, Cart Building, Identity Linking, Checkout, and Order Management.
