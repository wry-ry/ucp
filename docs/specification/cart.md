# Cart Capability

* **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.shopping.cart`

## Overview

The Cart capability enables basket building without the complexity of checkout.
While [Checkout](checkout.md) manages payment handlers, status lifecycle, and
order finalization, cart provides a lightweight CRUD interface for item
collection before purchase intent is established.

**When to use Cart vs Checkout:**

* **Cart**: User is exploring, comparing, saving items for later. No payment
  configuration needed. Platform/agent can freely add, remove, update items.
* **Checkout**: User has expressed purchase intent. Payment handlers are
  configured, status lifecycle begins, session moves toward completion.

The typical flow: `cart session` &#8594; `checkout session` &#8594; `order`

Carts support:

* **Incremental building**: Add/remove items across sessions
* **Localized estimates**: Context-aware pricing without full checkout overhead
* **Sharing**: `continue_url` enables cart sharing and recovery

## Cart vs Checkout

| Aspect | Cart | Checkout |
| ------ | ---- | -------- |
| **Purpose** | Pre-purchase exploration | Purchase finalization |
| **Payment** | None | Required (handlers, instruments) |
| **Status** | Binary (exists/not found) | Lifecycle (`incomplete` → `completed`) |
| **Complete Operation** | No | Yes |
| **Totals** | Estimates (may be partial) | Final pricing |

## Cart-to-Checkout Conversion

When the cart capability is negotiated, platforms can convert a cart to checkout
by providing `cart_id` in the Create Checkout request. The cart contents
(`line_items`, `context`, `buyer`) initialize the checkout session.

```json
{
  "cart_id": "cart_abc123",
  "line_items": []
}
```

Business MUST use cart contents and MUST ignore overlapping fields in checkout payload.
The `cart_id` parameter is only available when the cart capability is advertised
in the business profile.

**Idempotent conversion:**

If an incomplete checkout already exists for the given `cart_id`, the business
MUST return the existing checkout session rather than creating a new one. This
ensures a single active checkout per cart and prevents conflicting sessions.

**Cart lifecycle after conversion:**

When checkout is initialized via `cart_id`, the cart and checkout sessions
SHOULD be linked for the duration of the checkout.

* **During active checkout** — Business SHOULD maintain the cart and reflect
    relevant checkout modifications (quantity changes, item removals) back to
    the cart. This supports back-to-storefront flows when buyers transition
    between checkout and storefront.

* **After checkout completion** — Business MAY clear the cart based on TTL,
    completion of the checkout, or other business logic. Subsequent operations
    on a cleared cart ID return `not_found`; the platform can start a new
    session with `create_cart`.

## Guidelines

### Platform

* **MAY** use carts for pre-purchase exploration and session persistence.
* **SHOULD** convert cart to checkout when user expresses purchase intent.
* **MAY** display `continue_url` for handoff to business UI.
* **SHOULD** handle `not_found` gracefully when cart expires or is canceled.

### Business

* **SHOULD** provide `continue_url` for cart handoff and session recovery.
* TODO: discuss `continue_url` destination - cart vs checkout.
* **SHOULD** provide estimated totals when calculable.
* **MAY** omit fulfillment totals until checkout when address is unknown.
* **SHOULD** return informational messages for validation warnings.
* **MAY** set cart expiry via `expires_at`.
* **SHOULD** follow [cart lifecycle requirements](#cart-to-checkout-conversion)
    when checkout is initialized via `cart_id`.

## Operations

The Cart capability defines the following logical operations.

| Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Create Cart** | Creates a new cart session. |
| **Get Cart** | Retrieves the current state of a cart session. |
| **Update Cart** | Updates a cart session. |
| **Cancel Cart** | Cancels a cart session. |

### Create Cart

Creates a new cart session with line items and optional buyer/context
information for localized pricing estimates.

* [REST Binding](cart-rest.md#create-cart)
* [MCP Binding](cart-mcp.md#create_cart)

### Get Cart

Retrieves the latest state of a cart session. Returns `not_found` if the cart
does not exist, has expired, or was canceled.

* [REST Binding](cart-rest.md#get-cart)
* [MCP Binding](cart-mcp.md#get_cart)

### Update Cart

Performs a full replacement of the cart session. The platform **MUST** send
the entire cart resource. The provided resource replaces the existing cart
state on the business side.

* [REST Binding](cart-rest.md#update-cart)
* [MCP Binding](cart-mcp.md#update_cart)

### Cancel Cart

Cancels a cart session. Business MUST return the cart state before deletion.
Subsequent operations for this cart ID SHOULD return `not_found`.

* [REST Binding](cart-rest.md#cancel-cart)
* [MCP Binding](cart-mcp.md#cancel_cart)

## Entities

Cart reuses the same entity schemas as [Checkout](checkout.md). This ensures
consistent data structures when converting a cart to a checkout session.

### Line Item

#### Line Item Create Request

{{ schema_fields('types/line_item_create_req', 'checkout') }}

#### Line Item Update Request

{{ schema_fields('types/line_item_update_req', 'checkout') }}

#### Line Item Response

{{ schema_fields('types/line_item_resp', 'checkout') }}

### Buyer

{{ schema_fields('buyer', 'checkout') }}

### Context

{{ schema_fields('context', 'checkout') }}

### Total

{{ schema_fields('types/total_resp', 'checkout') }}

Taxes MAY be included where calculable. Platforms SHOULD assume cart totals
are estimates; accurate taxes are computed at checkout.

### Message

{{ schema_fields('message', 'checkout') }}

#### Message Error

{{ schema_fields('types/message_error', 'checkout') }}

#### Message Info

{{ schema_fields('types/message_info', 'checkout') }}

#### Message Warning

{{ schema_fields('types/message_warning', 'checkout') }}

### Link

{{ schema_fields('types/link', 'checkout') }}
