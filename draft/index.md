# Universal Commerce Protocol

The common language for platforms, agents and businesses.

UCP defines building blocks for agentic commerce—from discovering and buying to post purchase experiences—allowing the ecosystem to interoperate through one standard, without custom builds.

## Co-developed and adopted by industry leaders

UCP was built by the industry, for the industry to solve for fragmented commerce journeys that lead to abandoned carts and frustrated shoppers, and enable agentic commerce.

## Built for flexibility, security, and scale

Agentic commerce demands interoperability. UCP is built on industry standards — REST and JSON-RPC transports; [Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)](https://ap2-protocol.org/), [Agent2Agent (A2A)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/), and [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) support built-in — so different systems can work together without custom integration.

### Scalable and universal

Surface-agnostic design that can scale to support any commerce entity (from small businesses to enterprise scale) and all modalities (chat, visual commerce, voice, etc).

### Businesses at the center

Built to facilitate commerce, ensuring retailers retain control of their business rules and remain the Merchant of Record with full ownership of the customer relationship.

### Open and extensible

Open and extensible by design, enabling development of community-driven capabilities and extensions across verticals.

### Secure and private

Built on proven security standards for account linking (OAuth 2.0) and secure payment (AP2) via payment mandates and verifiable credentials.

### Frictionless payments

Open wallet ecosystem with interoperability between providers to ensure buyers can pay with their preferred payment methods.

## See it in action

UCP is designed to facilitate the entire commerce lifecycle, from initial product discovery and search to final sale and post-purchase support. The protocol's initial launch focuses on three core capabilities: Checkout, Identity Linking, and Order Management.
