# Buyer Consent Extension

## Overview

The Buyer Consent extension lets businesses communicate the consent options they offer and lets platforms transmit buyers' consent decisions for data usage and communication preferences — purposes like marketing, analytics, preferences, and sale or sharing of data.

Consent is modeled as a two-level structure:

- **Purpose** — what the consent is for. Keyed at the top level by a reverse-DNS identifier (e.g., `dev.ucp.consent.marketing`). Each purpose carries a `granted` state, a `source` identifying who asserted that state, a human-readable `description`, and optional `links`.
- **Segment** — an optional refinement scoping the parent purpose to a specific channel (e.g., email, SMS), vendor (e.g., a measurement provider), or program. Each segment has the same shape (`granted`, `source`, `description`, optional `links`) and overrides the parent purpose for its specific scope.

The structure is bounded to one level of nesting: purposes have segments; segments do not nest further.

## Scope

This extension defines the mechanism by which businesses and platforms establish and communicate buyer consent state. It does not dictate either party's behavior in response to that state — how a business acts on it (e.g., sending emails, sharing data) and how a platform surfaces existing decisions to the buyer (e.g., displaying current subscription state with an unsubscribe affordance) are governed by business policy and applicable regulation, not by this specification.

Businesses are responsible for selecting the initial `granted` value according to their applicable policy before advertising consent options. The advertised value with `source: "business"` is the business's authoritative default; buyers may override it through the platform. Policy reasoning remains the business's responsibility.

## Discovery

Businesses advertise consent support in their profile. The capability can extend cart, checkout, or both:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "dev.ucp.shopping.buyer_consent": [
      {
        "version": "draft",
        "extends": [
          "dev.ucp.shopping.cart",
          "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema Composition

When this capability is active, the **buyer object** within cart and/or checkout carries a `consent` field:

- **Cart path**: `cart.buyer.consent`
- **Checkout path**: `checkout.buyer.consent`

The `buyer` object (and therefore `consent`) is optional on all cart and checkout operations — cart `create` / `update`, and checkout `create` / `update` / `complete`. Platforms MAY submit captured consent on `complete_checkout` alongside payment.

## Schema Definition

### Consent Object

A map of per-purpose consent decisions. Keys are reverse-DNS purpose identifiers such as `dev.ucp.consent.marketing` or `com.example.purpose.loyalty`. Values are [Consent Purpose](#consent-purpose) objects. A purpose may contain nested [Consent Segment](#consent-segment) refinements for channel, vendor, or program scopes.

### Consent Purpose

A buyer's consent decision for a purpose (e.g., marketing, analytics). Carries the current binary state, its source (business default or platform-captured buyer decision), human-readable context, and optional refinements scoping the decision to specific channels, vendors, or programs.

| Name        | Type          | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| granted     | boolean       | **Yes**  | Whether consent has been granted for this purpose. The `source` field identifies who asserted this state (business default or platform-captured buyer preference).                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| source      | string        | **Yes**  | Identifies the party that asserted the current `granted` value. `business` means the value reflects the business's default policy; `platform` means the value reflects an explicit buyer decision captured by the platform. **Enum:** `business`, `platform`                                                                                              |
| description | string        | **Yes**  | Human-readable description of what the buyer is consenting to (e.g., 'Promotional communications across all channels').                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| links       | Array[object] | No       | Optional links providing context (e.g., privacy policy, terms).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| segments    | object        | No       | Optional refinements scoping this purpose to specific channels, vendors, or programs. Keys are reverse-DNS identifiers. UCP currently defines two well-known segment identifiers under `dev.ucp.consent.marketing`: `dev.ucp.consent.marketing.email`, `dev.ucp.consent.marketing.sms`. Other segments follow vendor or merchant reverse-DNS conventions. |

### Consent Segment

A buyer's consent decision for a specific refinement of a parent purpose (e.g., email marketing under the marketing purpose). Overrides the parent's `granted` value for this scope. Segments do not nest further.

| Name        | Type          | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| granted     | boolean       | **Yes**  | Whether consent has been granted for this segment. Overrides the parent purpose's `granted` value for this specific scope.                                                                                                                                                    |
| source      | string        | **Yes**  | Identifies the party that asserted the current `granted` value for this segment. `business` means the value reflects the business's default policy; `platform` means the value reflects an explicit buyer decision captured by the platform. **Enum:** `business`, `platform` |
| description | string        | **Yes**  | Human-readable description of what the buyer is consenting to within this segment (e.g., 'Promotional emails and exclusive offers').                                                                                                                                          |
| links       | Array[object] | No       | Optional segment-specific links (e.g., channel terms or privacy disclosures).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Well-known purposes

This extension defines four well-known purpose identifiers under the `dev.ucp.consent.*` namespace. Businesses may define additional purposes under reverse-DNS namespaces they control. These identifiers are operational definitions, not legal taxonomies.

| Identifier                        | Purpose                                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev.ucp.consent.analytics`       | Analytics and performance measurement               |
| `dev.ucp.consent.marketing`       | Marketing communications                            |
| `dev.ucp.consent.preferences`     | Remembering buyer preferences                       |
| `dev.ucp.consent.sale_or_sharing` | Sale or sharing of personal data with third parties |

## Well-known segments

For the `dev.ucp.consent.marketing` purpose, this extension defines well-known channel segment identifiers:

| Identifier                        | Channel |
| --------------------------------- | ------- |
| `dev.ucp.consent.marketing.email` | Email   |
| `dev.ucp.consent.marketing.sms`   | SMS     |

## Advertise and confirm

The same map shape carries two complementary directions of information:

| Direction                | Who populates | Fields populated                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advertise** (response) | Business      | `granted`, `source`, `description`; `links` and `segments` when present |
| **Confirm** (request)    | Platform      | `granted`, `source`; `segments` when present                            |

`description` and `links` are response-only; the platform does not echo them on confirm. `granted` and `source` are required in both directions: businesses send the current state and its source when advertising; platforms send the current state and its source when confirming.

The `source` field carries the authorship of the current `granted` value:

- `source: "business"` means the value reflects the business's default; no buyer preference applies.
- `source: "platform"` means the value reflects the buyer's stated preference, captured by the platform.

The source signals how the platform should treat the current value: `source: "business"` invites the platform to present the choice for buyer engagement; `source: "platform"` indicates a recorded buyer preference.

### Example: purposes and segments

The simplest case is purpose-level consent capture — `analytics` here shows the buyer's consent recorded at the parent. Purposes can also carry segments for finer-grained control: `marketing` is set to off, but the buyer has consented to SMS marketing. The segment's `granted: true` overrides the parent's `granted: false` for that scope (more-specific values win).

```json
{
  "ucp": { ... },
  "id": "checkout_456",
  "status": "ready_for_complete",
  "currency": "USD",
  "buyer": {
    "consent": {
      "dev.ucp.consent.analytics": {
        "granted": true,
        "source": "platform",
        "description": "Site analytics and performance measurement"
      },
      "dev.ucp.consent.marketing": {
        "granted": false,
        "source": "business",
        "description": "Promotional communications",
        "segments": {
          "dev.ucp.consent.marketing.email": {
            "granted": false,
            "source": "business",
            "description": "Promotional emails"
          },
          "dev.ucp.consent.marketing.sms": {
            "granted": true,
            "source": "platform",
            "description": "Marketing text messages"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The buyer has engaged with two specific choices (analytics broadly, SMS marketing specifically); both carry `source: "platform"`. The remaining values (parent `marketing`, `email` segment) carry `source: "business"`.

### Advertise example

Businesses advertise available purposes and segments with the current consent state (either the buyer's prior decision or the business default):

```json
{
  "ucp": { ... },
  "id": "checkout_456",
  "status": "ready_for_complete",
  "currency": "USD",
  "buyer": {
    "consent": {
      "dev.ucp.consent.marketing": {
        "granted": false,
        "source": "business",
        "description": "Promotional communications across all channels",
        "links": [{ "type": "privacy_policy", "url": "https://example.com/privacy" }],
        "segments": {
          "dev.ucp.consent.marketing.email": {
            "granted": true,
            "source": "platform",
            "description": "Promotional emails and exclusive offers"
          },
          "dev.ucp.consent.marketing.sms": {
            "granted": false,
            "source": "business",
            "description": "Marketing text messages",
            "links": [{ "type": "terms_of_service", "url": "https://example.com/sms-terms" }]
          },
          "com.example.channel.marketing": {
            "granted": false,
            "source": "business",
            "description": "Marketing messages via a third-party channel"
          }
        }
      },
      "dev.ucp.consent.analytics": {
        "granted": true,
        "source": "business",
        "description": "Site analytics and performance measurement",
        "segments": {
          "com.example.analytics": {
            "granted": false,
            "source": "business",
            "description": "Third-party analytics measurement",
            "links": [{ "type": "privacy_policy", "url": "https://example.com/analytics-privacy" }]
          }
        }
      },
      "dev.ucp.consent.preferences": {
        "granted": true,
        "source": "business",
        "description": "Remember preferences and personalize the shopping experience"
      },
      "dev.ucp.consent.sale_or_sharing": {
        "granted": false,
        "source": "platform",
        "description": "Sale or sharing of personal data with third parties",
        "links": [{ "type": "privacy_policy", "url": "https://example.com/privacy" }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the buyer has previously opted in to promotional email (`marketing.email` shows `source: "platform"`) and previously opted out of data sale (`sale_or_sharing` shows `source: "platform"`). Every other choice remains at its business-asserted default and is a candidate for the platform to surface for explicit capture.

### Confirm example

Platforms submit the current state of every advertised purpose and segment in a subsequent `update_checkout` or `complete_checkout` request. For each choice, the platform echoes the advertised `granted` and `source` when no buyer preference applies, or sets `source: "platform"` with the buyer's stated `granted` value when one does.

```json
{
  "buyer": {
    "consent": {
      "dev.ucp.consent.marketing": {
        "granted": true,
        "source": "platform",
        "segments": {
          "dev.ucp.consent.marketing.email": { "granted": true,  "source": "platform" },
          "dev.ucp.consent.marketing.sms":   { "granted": true,  "source": "platform" },
          "com.example.channel.marketing":   { "granted": false, "source": "business" }
        }
      },
      "dev.ucp.consent.analytics": {
        "granted": true,
        "source": "business",
        "segments": {
          "com.example.analytics": { "granted": false, "source": "business" }
        }
      },
      "dev.ucp.consent.preferences":     { "granted": true,  "source": "business" },
      "dev.ucp.consent.sale_or_sharing": { "granted": false, "source": "platform" }
    }
  }
}
```

Here, the buyer opted in to marketing on email and SMS; other choices are echoed at their advertised values, including `sale_or_sharing` which retains a prior platform-captured choice.

## Data dependencies

Some consent states depend on additional buyer or checkout data. For example, SMS marketing consent requires a buyer phone number. When the platform confirms a consent value whose required dependency is missing, businesses surface the gap through the standard [Checkout Status Lifecycle](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/checkout/#checkout-status-lifecycle) and [Error Handling](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/checkout/#error-handling) mechanisms.

On `create_cart`, `update_cart`, `create_checkout`, and `update_checkout`, businesses SHOULD surface missing dependencies as `warning` messages so the platform can collect the data on a subsequent operation. The advertised consent decisions remain valid; the warning is informational.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "warning",
    "code": "missing_consent_data",
    "content": "Phone number is required for SMS marketing.",
    "path": "$.buyer.phone_number"
  }
]
```

On `complete_checkout`, businesses MUST NOT transition the checkout to `completed` while a confirmed consent decision has unmet data dependencies. Missing dependencies MUST be surfaced via the standard [Error Handling](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/checkout/#error-handling) flow.

## Normative requirements

1. **Use the advertised settings.** Businesses MUST advertise the complete set of consent options they support. Platforms decide which choices to present to the buyer and when; when presenting a choice, platforms MUST use the advertised `description`, `links`, `granted` value, and purpose/segment grouping. The `source` field informs platform decisions (see [Advertise and confirm](#advertise-and-confirm)) and is not user-facing content. Identifiers outside the `dev.ucp.consent.*` namespace are opaque handles; platforms MUST NOT infer semantics from such paths alone. UCP-defined identifiers carry the semantics established in this specification.
1. **Confirm semantics.** The `consent` field is optional on requests; omitting it provides no consent update and the business retains its prior position. When submitting `consent`, platforms MUST include every advertised purpose and segment key, carrying both `granted` and `source` for each. Omitting an advertised key within a submitted `consent` map MUST NOT be used to signal any value.
1. **Advertised set is authoritative.** Businesses MUST ignore purposes and segments in a request that were not advertised in a prior response. Platforms MUST NOT prompt for or transmit purposes or segments the business did not advertise.
1. **More-specific values win.** For an advertised segment, the segment's `granted` value overrides the parent purpose's `granted` for that segment.
1. **Source attribution requires a buyer-stated preference.** Platforms MUST set `source: "platform"` only when the `granted` value reflects the buyer's stated preference. For choices to which no buyer preference applies, platforms MUST echo the advertised `source` unchanged. The protocol does not prescribe what counts as a buyer-stated preference; that determination is made by the platform under applicable policy.
1. **Per-business attribution.** A consent decision captured with a specific business is attributable only to that business; platforms MUST NOT propagate it as the basis for `source: "platform"` in a different business's request. Broader buyer preferences that are not tied to a specific business are independent of per-business decisions and may be applied to each business's advertised choices on their own basis.
1. **Persistence and reversibility.** Platforms MAY persist a buyer's prior preferences (`source: "platform"`) across interactions with the same business and MAY suppress re-presentation of unchanged values. Where preferences are persisted, platforms SHOULD give the buyer the ability to change them.
