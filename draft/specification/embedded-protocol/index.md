# Embedded Protocol (EP)

## Introduction

The Embedded Protocol (EP) is a UCP transport binding that enables a **host** to embed a **business's** interface in an iframe or webview and exchange structured messages over that channel. EP defines **how** to communicate — message format, channel setup, authentication, error handling, and security constraints. It does not define **what** data exists; that is the responsibility of each capability that binds to EP.

Each capability implements EP methods under its own method prefix. For example, checkout uses the `ec.*` prefix and cart uses the `ep.cart.*` prefix. The shared patterns described in this document apply uniformly across all EP capabilities.

Capability-specific details — discovery, URL parameters, delegation contracts, message payloads, and schema definitions — are defined in each capability's EP binding specification:

- [Checkout Capability — EP Binding](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-checkout/index.md)
- [Cart Capability — EP Binding](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-cart/index.md)

## Terminology & Actors

### Commerce Roles

- **Business:** The seller providing goods or services.
- **Buyer:** The end user making a purchase.

### Technical Components

- **Host:** The application embedding the business's interface (e.g., AI Agent app, Super App, Browser). Responsible for user authentication and, when delegated, native UI for actions such as payment and address selection.
- **Embedded Context:** The business's interface rendered in an iframe or webview. Responsible for the capability-specific flow (e.g., checkout, cart building).

## Transport & Messaging

### Message Format

All EP messages **MUST** use JSON-RPC 2.0 format ([RFC 7159](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7159)). Each message **MUST** contain:

- `jsonrpc`: **MUST** be `"2.0"`
- `method`: The message name (e.g., `"ec.start"`, `"ep.cart.start"`)
- `params`: Message-specific payload (may be empty object)
- `id`: (Optional) Present only for requests that expect responses

### Message Types

**Requests** (with `id` field):

- Require a response from the receiver
- **MUST** include a unique `id` field
- Receiver **MUST** respond with matching `id`
- Response **MUST** be either a `result` or an `error_response`
- Used for operations requiring acknowledgment or data

**Notifications** (without `id` field):

- Informational only, no response expected
- **MUST NOT** include an `id` field
- Receiver **MUST NOT** send a response
- Used for state updates and informational events

### Response Handling

For requests (messages with `id`), receivers **MUST** respond with a `result`. Both success and error outcomes **MUST** be returned via the `result` field, consistent with UCP's two-layer error model. The JSON-RPC `error` field is reserved for transport-level failures (parse errors, method not found, invalid params). Implementations **MUST NOT** use the JSON-RPC `error` field for application-level error codes.

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "...",
  "result": {
    "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "success" },
    ...
  }
}
```

**Error Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "...",
  "result": {
    "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "error" },
    "messages": [...]
  }
}
```

In both cases, `result.ucp.status` serves as the discriminator between success and error outcomes — the same pattern used across all UCP transports.

### Transport Errors

Transport errors are protocol-level failures that prevent request processing. These are returned as JSON-RPC `error` using standard JSON-RPC error codes and indicate the message itself is invalid or could not be processed — not that executed business logic produced an error outcome. See the [Core Specification](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/overview/#error-codes) for the complete error code registry.

For example, if a request cannot be processed (unknown method, malformed params), the host **MUST** respond with a JSON-RPC `error`:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "req_1",
    "error": {
        "code": -32601,
        "message": "Method not found."
    }
}
```

## Communication Channels

### Web-Based Hosts

When the host is a web application, communication starts using `postMessage` between the host and the embedded context's window. The host **MUST** listen for `postMessage` calls from the embedded window, and when a message is received, **MUST** validate that the origin matches the `continue_url` used to start the session.

Upon validation, the host **MAY** create a `MessageChannel` and transfer one of its ports in the `ready` response. When a host responds with a `MessagePort`, all subsequent messages **MUST** be sent over that channel. Otherwise, the host and business **MUST** continue using `postMessage()` between their `window` objects, including origin validation.

### Native Hosts

When the host is a native application, it **MUST** inject globals into the embedded context that allow `postMessage` communication between the web and native environments. Each capability defines the names of its globals following the pattern:

- `window.Embedded{Capability}ProtocolConsumer` (preferred)
- `window.webkit.messageHandlers.Embedded{Capability}ProtocolConsumer`

This object **MUST** implement the following interface:

```javascript
{
  postMessage(message: string): void
}
```

Where `message` is a JSON-stringified JSON-RPC 2.0 message. The host **MUST** parse the JSON string before processing.

For messages traveling from the host to the embedded context, the host **MUST** inject JavaScript in the webview that calls `window.Embedded{Capability}Protocol.postMessage()` with the JSON-RPC message. The embedded context **MUST** initialize this global object — and start listening for `postMessage()` calls — before the capability's `ready` message is sent.

See each capability's EP binding for the specific global names:

- **Checkout:** `EmbeddedCheckoutProtocolConsumer` / `EmbeddedCheckoutProtocol`
- **Cart:** `EmbeddedCartProtocolConsumer` / `EmbeddedCartProtocol`

## Message Patterns

### Handshake

Upon rendering, the embedded context **MUST** broadcast readiness to the host using the capability's `ready` message. This message initializes a secure communication channel between the host and embedded context, communicates which delegations were accepted, and signals whether additional authorization exchange is needed.

**General flow:**

1. Embedded context sends a `ready` request with a `delegate` list and optional `auth` request
1. Host responds with:
   - `ucp` envelope confirming the negotiated protocol version
   - Optional `upgrade` with a `MessagePort` for channel upgrade
   - Optional `credential` with requested authorization data
   - Optional capability-specific state (e.g., checkout delegation state)
1. If the host includes an `upgrade`, the embedded context **MUST** discard all other fields in the response, switch to the upgraded channel, and send a new `ready` message over that channel
1. If the host responds with an `error_response` result, the session cannot proceed — the host **MUST** tear down the embedded context and **MAY** redirect the buyer to `continue_url` if available. The embedded context **MUST NOT** send further messages after receiving a handshake error.

Each capability defines the full `ready` method specification, including capability-specific parameters and result fields.

### Authentication

The embedded context **MAY** request authorization from the host after the initial handshake — for example, to refresh an expired OAuth token. This exchange uses the capability's auth method (e.g., `ec.auth` for checkout, `ep.cart.auth` for cart).

**Request:**

- **Direction:** Embedded Context → Host
- **Type:** Request
- **Payload:**
  - `type` (string, **REQUIRED**): The requested authorization type (e.g., `"oauth"`, `"api_key"`, `"jwt"`).

**Success Response:**

- **Direction:** Host → Embedded Context
- **Type:** Response
- **Result Payload:**
  - `ucp` (object, **REQUIRED**): UCP protocol metadata with `status: "success"`.
  - `credential` (string, **REQUIRED**): The requested authorization data.

**Error Response:**

The host **MUST** respond with a `result` containing either the authorization data or an `error_response`.

**Example Success Response:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "auth_1",
    "result": {
        "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "success" },
        "credential": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs..."
    }
}
```

**Example Error Response:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "auth_1",
    "result": {
        "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "error" },
        "messages": [
            {
                "type": "error",
                "code": "timeout_error",
                "content": "An internal service timed out when fetching the required authorization data.",
                "severity": "recoverable"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

**Error Escalation:**

If the error is transient (indicated by `recoverable` severity), the embedded context **MAY** re-initiate the auth request. Otherwise, the embedded context **MUST** issue a session error notification (see [Session Error](#session-error)) containing an `unrecoverable` error response. This escalation also applies when the embedded context is unable to process a host-provided credential (e.g., the credential is corrupted). The session error **SHOULD** include a `continue_url` to allow buyer handoff.

**Example — auth failure escalated to session error:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ec.error",
    "params": {
        "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "error" },
        "messages": [
            {
                "type": "error",
                "code": "not_supported_error",
                "content": "Requested auth credential type is not supported",
                "severity": "unrecoverable"
            }
        ],
        "continue_url": "https://merchant.example.com"
    }
}
```

When the host receives this notification, it **MUST** tear down the embedded context and **SHOULD** display an appropriate error state. If `continue_url` is present, the host **MUST** use it to hand off the buyer for session recovery.

### Session Error

A session error signals a fatal condition unrelated to the capability's resource — for example, a terminal auth failure that prevents the session from continuing. Each capability defines its own session error notification method (e.g., `ec.error` for checkout, `ep.cart.error` for cart).

**Notification Payload:**

- `ucp` (object, **REQUIRED**): UCP protocol metadata. `status` **MUST** be `"error"`.
- `messages` (array, **REQUIRED**): One or more messages describing the failure.
- `continue_url` (string, **OPTIONAL**): URL for buyer handoff or session recovery.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ec.error",
    "params": {
        "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "error" },
        "messages": [
            {
                "type": "error",
                "code": "not_supported_error",
                "content": "Requested auth credential type is not supported.",
                "severity": "unrecoverable"
            }
        ],
        "continue_url": "https://merchant.example.com/checkout/abc123"
    }
}
```

**Host Handling:**

When the host receives a session error notification, it **MUST** tear down the embedded context and **SHOULD** display an appropriate error state to the buyer. If `continue_url` is present, the host **MUST** use it to hand off the buyer for session recovery.

### Lifecycle

Each capability defines `start` and `complete` notification methods that follow a shared contract:

- **`start`**: The embedded context notifies the host that the UI is visible and ready for interaction. The notification **MUST** include the full current state of the capability's resource (e.g., the checkout or cart object).
- **`complete`**: The embedded context notifies the host that the capability flow has finished successfully. The notification **MUST** include the final state of the resource.

Both are notifications — the host **MUST NOT** respond.

**Example — start notification (cart):**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ep.cart.start",
    "params": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "cart_123",
            "currency": "USD",
            "totals": [/* ... */],
            "line_items": [/* ... */],
            "buyer": {/* ... */}
        }
    }
}
```

**Example — complete notification (checkout):**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ec.complete",
    "params": {
        "checkout": {
            "id": "checkout_123",
            // ... other checkout fields
            "order": {
                "id": "ord_99887766",
                "permalink_url": "https://merchant.com/orders/ord_99887766"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### State Change

State change notifications inform the host of changes that have already occurred in the embedded context. These are informational only — the embedded context has already applied the changes and rendered the updated UI. The host **MUST NOT** respond to state change notifications.

Each capability defines its own set of state change methods covering the relevant resource fields (e.g., line items, buyer information, totals). State change notifications **MUST** include the full current state of the capability's resource, not just the changed fields.

**Example — line items changed (checkout):**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ec.line_items.change",
    "params": {
        "checkout": {
            "id": "checkout_123",
            "totals": [/* ... */],
            "line_items": [/* ... */]
            // ... other checkout fields
        }
    }
}
```

**Example — messages changed (cart):**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ep.cart.messages.change",
    "params": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "cart_123",
            "line_items": [/* ... */],
            "messages": [
                {
                    "type": "error",
                    "code": "invalid_quantity",
                    "path": "$.line_items[0].quantity",
                    "content": "Quantity must be at least 1",
                    "severity": "recoverable"
                }
            ]
            // ... other cart fields
        }
    }
}
```

## Error Codes

The Embedded Protocol defines a shared set of error codes. Capabilities **MAY** define additional error codes for capability-specific scenarios.

| Code                  | Severity        | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `abort_error`         | `recoverable`   | The user cancelled the interaction (e.g., closed the sheet).    |
| `security_error`      | `unrecoverable` | The host origin validation failed.                              |
| `invalid_state_error` | `unrecoverable` | Handshake was attempted out of order.                           |
| `not_supported_error` | `unrecoverable` | The requested operation or authorization type is not supported. |
| `timeout_error`       | `recoverable`   | An internal service timed out. The operation may be retried.    |

Errors **SHOULD** use only `recoverable` and `unrecoverable` severities. `recoverable` means the operation may be re-attempted. `unrecoverable` means the operation cannot succeed in the current session.

## Security

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

To ensure security, both parties **MUST** implement appropriate **[Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)** directives:

- **Business:** **MUST** set `frame-ancestors <host_origin>;` to ensure it's only embedded by trusted hosts.

- **Host:**

  - **Direct Embedding:** If the host directly embeds the business's page, specifying a `frame-src` directive listing every potential business origin can be impractical, especially if there are many businesses. In this scenario, while a strict `frame-src` is ideal, other security measures like those in [Iframe Sandbox Attributes](#iframe-sandbox-attributes) and [Credentialless Iframes](#credentialless-iframes) are critical.
  - **Intermediate Iframe:** The host **MAY** use an intermediate iframe (e.g., on a host-controlled subdomain) to embed the business's page. This offers better control:
    - The host's main page only needs to allow the origin of the intermediate iframe in its `frame-src` (e.g., `frame-src <intermediate_iframe_origin>;`).
    - The intermediate iframe **MUST** implement a strict `frame-src` policy, dynamically set to allow *only* the specific `<merchant_origin>` for the current embedded session (e.g., `frame-src <merchant_origin>;`). This can be set via HTTP headers when serving the intermediate iframe content.

### Iframe Sandbox Attributes

All business iframes **MUST** be sandboxed to restrict their capabilities. The following sandbox attributes **SHOULD** be applied, but a host and business **MAY** negotiate additional capabilities:

```html
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-forms allow-same-origin"></iframe>
```

### Credentialless Iframes

Hosts **SHOULD** use the `credentialless` attribute on the iframe to load it in a new, ephemeral context. This prevents the business from correlating user activity across contexts or accessing existing sessions, protecting user privacy.

```html
<iframe credentialless src="https://business.example.com/..."></iframe>
```

### Strict Origin Validation

Enforce strict validation of the `origin` for all `postMessage` communications between frames.
