# Cart Capability - EP Binding

## Introduction

Embedded Cart Protocol (ECaP) is a cart-specific implementation of UCP's Embedded Protocol (EP) transport binding that enables a **host** to embed a **business's** cart interface and receive events as the buyer interacts with the cart. ECaP is a transport binding (like REST)—it defines **how** to communicate, not **what** data exists.

## Terminology & Actors

### Commerce Roles

- **Business:** The seller providing goods/services and the cart building experience.
- **Buyer:** The end user looking to make a purchase through the cart building exercise.

### Technical Components

- **Host:** The application embedding the cart (e.g., AI Agent app, Super App, Browser). Responsible for user authentication (including any prerequisites like identity linking).
- **Embedded Cart:** The business's cart interface rendered in an iframe or webview. Responsible for the cart building flow and potential transition into lower-funnel constructs like checkout creations.

### Discovery

ECaP availability is signaled via service discovery. When a business advertises the `embedded` transport in their `/.well-known/ucp` profile, all cart `continue_url` values support the Embedded Cart Protocol.

**Service Discovery Example:**

```json
{
    "services": {
        "dev.ucp.shopping": [
            {
                "version": "draft",
                "transport": "rest",
                "schema": "https://ucp.dev/draft/services/shopping/rest.openapi.json",
                "endpoint": "https://merchant.example.com/ucp/v1"
            },
            {
                "version": "draft",
                "transport": "mcp",
                "schema": "https://ucp.dev/draft/services/shopping/mcp.openrpc.json",
                "endpoint": "https://merchant.example.com/ucp/mcp"
            },
            {
                "version": "draft",
                "transport": "embedded",
                "schema": "https://ucp.dev/draft/services/shopping/embedded.openrpc.json"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

When `embedded` is absent from the service definition, the business only supports redirect-based cart continuation via `continue_url`.

#### Per-Cart Configuration

Service-level discovery declares that a business supports ECaP, but does not guarantee that business will enable it for every cart session. Businesses **MUST** include an embedded service binding with `config.delegate` in cart responses to indicate ECaP availability and allowed delegations for a specific session.

**Cart Response Example:**

```json
{
    "id": "cart_123",
    "continue_url": "https://merchant.example.com/cart/cart123",
    "ucp": {
        "version": "draft",
        "services": {
            "dev.ucp.shopping": [
                {
                    "version": "draft",
                    "transport": "embedded",
                    "config": {
                        "delegate": []
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "capabilities": {...},
        "payment_handlers": {...}
    }
    // ...other cart fields...
}
```

### Loading an Embedded Cart URL

When a host receives a cart response with a `continue_url` from a business that advertises ECaP support, it **MAY** initiate an ECaP session by loading the URL in an embedded context.

**Example:**

```text
https://example.com/cart/cart123?ep_version=2026-01-23...
```

Note: All query parameter values must be properly URL-encoded per RFC 3986.

Before loading the embedded context, the host **SHOULD**:

1. Check `config.delegate` in the response for available delegations
1. Optionally complete authentication mechanisms (i.e. identity linking) if required by the business

To initiate the session, the host **MUST** augment the `continue_url` with supported ECaP query parameters.

All ECaP parameters are passed via URL query string, not HTTP headers, to ensure maximum compatibility across different embedding environments. Parameters **SHOULD** use either `ep` or `ep_cart` prefixes to avoid namespace pollution and clearly distinguish ECaP parameters from business-specific query parameters:

- `ep_version` (string, **REQUIRED**): The UCP version for this session (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`). Must match the version from service discovery.
- `ep_auth` (string, **OPTIONAL**): Authentication token in business-defined format.
- `ep_color_scheme` (string, **OPTIONAL**): The color scheme preference for the cart UI. Valid values: `light`, `dark`. When not provided, the Embedded Cart follows system preference.
- `ep_cart_delegate` (string, **OPTIONAL**): Comma-delimited list of delegations the host wants to handle. **MAY** be empty if no delegations are needed. **SHOULD** be a subset of `config.delegate` from the embedded service binding.

## Transport & Messaging

ECaP uses the shared EP transport layer. See [Embedded Protocol — Transport & Messaging](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#transport-messaging) for message format, message types, and response handling conventions.

The `ucp.version` in all responses **MUST** echo the `ep_version` negotiated during session initialization and confirmed by the host in the `ep.cart.ready` response. The version is session-bound — it **MUST NOT** change for the duration of the ECaP session.

### Communication Channels

ECaP follows the shared EP communication channel model. See [Embedded Protocol — Communication Channels](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#communication-channels) for the general pattern.

For native hosts, the cart-specific globals are:

- `window.EmbeddedCartProtocolConsumer` (preferred)
- `window.webkit.messageHandlers.EmbeddedCartProtocolConsumer`
- `window.EmbeddedCartProtocol` (Host → Embedded Cart)

## Message API Reference

### Message Categories

#### Core Messages

Core messages are defined by the ECaP specification and **MUST** be supported by all implementations.

| Category           | Purpose                                                         | Pattern      | Core Messages                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Handshake**      | Establish connection between host and Embedded Cart.            | Request      | `ep.cart.ready`                                                                |
| **Authentication** | Communicate auth data exchanges between Embedded Cart and host. | Request      | `ep.cart.auth`                                                                 |
| **Lifecycle**      | Inform of cart state in Embedded Cart.                          | Notification | `ep.cart.start`, `ep.cart.complete`                                            |
| **State Change**   | Inform of cart field changes.                                   | Notification | `ep.cart.line_items.change`, `ep.cart.buyer.change`, `ep.cart.messages.change` |
| **Session Error**  | Signal a session-level error unrelated to the cart resource.    | Notification | `ep.cart.error`                                                                |

### Handshake Messages

#### `ep.cart.ready`

Upon rendering, the Embedded Cart **MUST** broadcast readiness to the parent context using the `ep.cart.ready` message. This message initializes a secure communication channel between the host and Embedded Cart, communicates whether or not additional auth exchange is needed, and allows the host to provide any requested authorization data back to Embedded Cart.

- **Direction:** Embedded Cart → Host
- **Type:** Request
- **Payload:**
  - `delegate` (array of strings, **REQUIRED**): List of delegation identifiers accepted by the Embedded Cart. **MUST** be a subset of both `ep_cart_delegate` (what host requested) and `config.delegate` from the cart response (what business allows). An empty array means no delegations were accepted.
  - `auth` (object, **OPTIONAL**): When `ep_auth` URL param is neither sufficient nor applicable due to additional considerations, business can request for authorization during initial handshake by specifying the `type` string within this object. This `type` string value is a mirror of the payload content included in [`ep.cart.auth`](#epcartauth).

**Example Message (no delegations accepted):**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "ready_1",
    "method": "ep.cart.ready",
    "params": {
        "delegate": [],
        "auth": {
            "type": "oauth"
        }
    }
}
```

The `ep.cart.ready` message is a request, which means that the host **MUST** respond to complete the handshake.

- **Direction:** Host → Embedded Cart
- **Type:** Response
- **Result Payload:**
  - `ucp` (object, **REQUIRED**): UCP protocol metadata. The `version` confirms the negotiated `ep_version` and `status` **MUST** be `"success"`.
  - `upgrade` (object, **OPTIONAL**): An object describing how the Embedded Cart should update the communication channel it uses to communicate with the host. When present, host **MUST NOT** include `credential` — the channel will be re-established and any credential sent here will be discarded.
  - `credential` (string, **OPTIONAL**): The requested authorization data, can be in the form of an OAuth token, JWT, API keys, etc. **MUST** be set if `auth` is present in the request. **MUST NOT** be set if `upgrade` is present.

**Example Message:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "ready_1",
    "result": {
        "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "success" },
        "credential": "fake_identity_linking_oauth_token"
    }
}
```

Hosts **MAY** respond with an `upgrade` field to update the communication channel between host and Embedded Cart. Currently, this object only supports a `port` field, which **MUST** be a `MessagePort` object, and **MUST** be transferred to the embedded cart context (e.g., with `{transfer: [port2]}` on the host's `iframe.contentWindow.postMessage()` call):

**Example Message:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "ready_1",
    "result": {
        "ucp": { "version": "draft", "status": "success" },
        "upgrade": {
            "port": "[Transferable MessagePort]"
        }
    }
}
```

When the host responds with an `upgrade` object, the Embedded Cart **MUST** discard any other information in the message, send a new `ep.cart.ready` message over the upgraded communication channel, and wait for a new response. All subsequent messages **MUST** be sent only over the upgraded communication channel.

If the host cannot complete the handshake (e.g., origin validation failure or protocol state violation), it **MUST** respond with an `error_response` result. When the host responds with an error, the session cannot proceed. The host **MUST** tear down the embedded context and **MAY** redirect the buyer to `continue_url` if present. The Embedded Cart **MUST NOT** send further messages after receiving a handshake error.

### Authentication

#### `ep.cart.auth`

`ep.cart.auth` implements the shared EP authentication pattern — see [Embedded Protocol — Authentication](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#authentication) for the request/response contract, examples, and error escalation flow.

- **Method:** `ep.cart.auth`
- **Direction:** Embedded Cart → Host (request); Host → Embedded Cart (response)

When error escalation is required, Embedded Cart **MUST** issue an `ep.cart.error` notification per the [session error pattern](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#session-error).

### Lifecycle Messages

Lifecycle notifications follow the shared EP pattern — see [Embedded Protocol — Lifecycle](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#lifecycle). All lifecycle notifications carry the full `cart` object as their payload.

#### `ep.cart.start`

Signals that cart is visible and ready for interaction. Sent after a successful `ep.cart.ready` handshake.

- **Direction:** Embedded Cart → Host
- **Type:** Notification
- **Payload:**
  - `cart` (object, **REQUIRED**): The full current state of the cart.

**Example Message:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ep.cart.start",
    "params": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "cart_123",
            "currency": "USD",
            "totals": [ ... ],
            "line_items": [ ... ],
            "buyer": { ... }
            // ...other cart fields...
        }
    }
}
```

#### `ep.cart.complete`

Indicates completion of cart building process and buyer now is ready to be transitioned to the next stage of their purchase journey.

This marks the completion of Embedded Cart. If `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout` is part of the negotiated capabilities during service discovery, host **MAY** proceed to initiate a checkout session based on the completed cart by issuing a [create checkout](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/checkout/#create-checkout) operation.

- **Direction:** Embedded Cart → Host
- **Type:** Notification
- **Payload:**
  - `cart` (object, **REQUIRED**): The final state of the cart.

**Example Message:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ep.cart.complete",
    "params": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "cart_123",
            "currency": "USD",
            "totals": [ ... ],
            "line_items": [ ... ],
            "buyer": { ... }
            // ...other cart fields...
        }
    }
}
```

### State Change Messages

State change notifications follow the shared EP pattern — see [Embedded Protocol — State Change](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#state-change). All state change notifications are sent from the Embedded Cart to the host and carry the full `cart` object as their payload.

#### `ep.cart.line_items.change`

Line items have been modified (quantity changed, items added/removed).

- **Direction:** Embedded Cart → Host
- **Type:** Notification
- **Payload:**
  - `cart` (object, **REQUIRED**): The full current state of the cart.

**Example Message:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ep.cart.line_items.change",
    "params": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "cart_123",
            // The entire cart object is provided, including the updated line items and estimated totals
            "totals": [ ... ],
            "line_items": [ ... ]
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

#### `ep.cart.buyer.change`

Buyer information has been updated (email, phone, name).

- **Direction:** Embedded Cart → Host
- **Type:** Notification
- **Payload:**
  - `cart` (object, **REQUIRED**): The full current state of the cart.

**Example Message:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ep.cart.buyer.change",
    "params": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "cart_123",
            // The entire cart object is provided, including the updated buyer information
            "buyer": { ... }
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

#### `ep.cart.messages.change`

Cart messages have been updated. Messages include errors, warnings, and informational notices about the cart state.

- **Direction:** Embedded Cart → Host
- **Type:** Notification
- **Payload:**
  - `cart` (object, **REQUIRED**): The full current state of the cart.

**Example Message:**

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "ep.cart.messages.change",
    "params": {
        "cart": {
            "id": "cart_123",
            // The entire cart object is provided, including any updated messages
            "messages": [
                {
                    "type": "error",
                    "code": "invalid_quantity",
                    "path": "$.line_items[0].quantity",
                    "content": "Quantity must be at least 1",
                    "severity": "recoverable"
                }
            ]
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Session Error Messages

#### `ep.cart.error`

`ep.cart.error` implements the shared EP session error pattern — see [Embedded Protocol — Session Error](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#session-error) for the payload specification and host handling requirements.

## Security & Error Handling

### Error Codes

ECaP uses the shared EP error code set — see [Embedded Protocol — Error Codes](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#error-codes).

### Security for Web-Based Hosts

ECaP inherits the shared EP security requirements for CSP, iframe sandboxing, credentialless iframes, and strict origin validation. See [Embedded Protocol — Security](https://wry-ry.github.io/ucp/draft/specification/embedded-protocol/#security) for the full specification.

## Schema Definitions

The following schemas define the data structures used within the Embedded Cart protocol.

### Cart

The core object representing the current state of the cart, including line items, totals, and buyer information.

| Name         | Type                                                                         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
