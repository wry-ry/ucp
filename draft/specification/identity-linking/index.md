# Identity Linking Capability

- **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.common.identity_linking`

## Overview

The Identity Linking capability enables a **platform** (e.g., Google, an agentic service) to obtain authorization to perform actions on behalf of a user on a **business**'s site.

This linkage is foundational for commerce experiences, such as accessing loyalty benefits, utilizing personalized offers, managing wishlists, and executing authenticated checkouts.

**This specification implements a Mechanism Registry pattern**, allowing platforms and businesses to negotiate the authentication mechanism dynamically. While [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) is the primary recommended mechanism, the design natively supports future extensibility securely.

## Mechanism Registry Pattern

The Identity Linking capability configuration acts as a **registry** of supported authentication mechanisms. Platforms and businesses discover and negotiate the mechanism exactly like other UCP capabilities.

### UCP Capability Declaration

Businesses **MUST** declare the supported mechanisms in the capability `config` using the `supported_mechanisms` array. Each mechanism must dictate its `type` using an open string vocabulary (e.g., `oauth2`, `verifiable_credential`) and provide the necessary resolution endpoints (like `issuer`).

```json
{
    "dev.ucp.common.identity_linking": [
        {
            "version": "2026-03-14",
            "config": {
                "supported_mechanisms": [
                    {
                        "type": "oauth2",
                        "issuer": "https://auth.merchant.example.com"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Mechanism Selection Algorithm

The `supported_mechanisms` array is **ordered by the business's preference** (index 0 = highest priority). Platforms **MUST** use the following algorithm to select a mechanism:

1. Iterate the `supported_mechanisms` array from index 0 (first element).
1. For each entry, check whether the platform supports the declared `type`.
1. Select the **first** entry whose `type` the platform supports and proceed with that mechanism.
1. If no entry in the array has a `type` the platform supports, the platform **MUST** abort the identity linking process. The platform **MUST NOT** attempt a partial or fallback linking flow.

If the platform supports multiple `type` values that appear in the array, the business's ordering takes precedence — the platform **MUST** use whichever supported type appears first in the array, regardless of the platform's own internal preference.

## Capability-Driven Scope Negotiation (Least Privilege)

To maintain the **Principle of Least Privilege**, authorization scopes are **NOT** hardcoded within the identity linking capability.

Instead, **authorization scopes are dynamically derived from the final intersection of negotiated capabilities**.

1. **Schema Declaration:** Each individual capability schema explicitly defines its own required identity scopes (e.g., `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout` declares `dev.ucp.shopping.scopes.checkout_session`).
1. **Dynamic Derivation:** During UCP Discovery, when the platform computes the intersection of supported capabilities between itself and the business, it extracts the required scopes from **only** the successfully negotiated capabilities.
1. **Authorization:** The platform initiates the connection requesting **exactly** the derived scopes — the union of `identity_scopes` from all capabilities in the finalized intersection. If a capability (e.g., `order`) is excluded from the active capability set, its respective scopes **MUST NOT** be requested by the platform. If the final derived scope list is completely empty, the platform **MUST** abort the identity linking process, as there are no secured resources to authorize.

### Scope Structure & Mapping

Consent screens **MUST** present permissions to users in clear, human-readable language that accurately describes what access is being granted. Rather than listing each individual operation (Get, Create, Update, Delete, etc.) as a separate line, consent screens **SHOULD** group them under a single capability-level description (e.g., "Allow [platform] to manage checkout sessions"). This grouping is for readability — it **MUST NOT** reduce the transparency of what access the user is authorizing. A scope grants access to all operations associated with the capability and the consent screen must accurately reflect that.

### Scope Naming Convention

Scopes **MUST** use **reverse DNS dot notation**, consistent with UCP capability names, to prevent namespace collisions:

- **UCP-defined scopes:** `dev.ucp.<domain>.scopes.<capability>` (e.g., `dev.ucp.shopping.scopes.checkout_session`)
- **Third-party scopes:** `<reverse-dns>.scopes.<capability>` (e.g., `com.example.loyalty.scopes.points_balance`)

This format strictly adheres to the scope token syntax defined in [RFC 6749 Section 3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3).

Example capability-to-scope mapping based on UCP schemas:

| Resources       | Operation                             | Scope Action                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| CheckoutSession | Get, Create, Update, Cancel, Complete | `dev.ucp.shopping.scopes.checkout_session` |

## Supported Mechanisms

### OAuth 2.0 (`"type": "oauth2"`)

When the negotiated mechanism type is `oauth2`, platforms and businesses **MUST** adhere to the following standard parameters.

#### Discovery Bridging

When a platform encounters `"type": "oauth2"`, it **MUST** parse the capability configuration and securely locate the Authorization Server metadata.

Platforms **MUST** implement the following resolution hierarchy to determine the discovery URL:

1. **Explicit Endpoint (Highest Priority)**: If the capability configuration provides a `discovery_endpoint` string, the platform **MUST** fetch metadata directly from that exact URI. If this fetch fails (e.g., non-2xx HTTP response or connection timeout), the platform **MUST** abort the discovery process and **MUST NOT** fall back to any other endpoints.
1. **RFC 8414 Standard Discovery**: If no explicit endpoint is provided, the platform **MUST** append `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` to the defined `issuer` string and fetch. If this fetch returns any non-2xx response other than `404 Not Found` (e.g., `500 Internal Server Error`, `503 Service Unavailable`), or if a connection timeout or network error occurs, the platform **MUST** abort the discovery process and **MUST NOT** proceed to the OIDC fallback.
1. **OIDC Fallback (Lowest Priority)**: If and only if the RFC 8414 fetch returns exactly `404 Not Found`, the platform **MUST** append `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to the defined `issuer` string and fetch. If this final fetch returns any non-2xx response or a network error, the platform **MUST** abort the identity linking process.

**Issuer Validation**: Regardless of the discovery method used above, the platform **MUST** perform an exact string comparison between the `issuer` value returned in the metadata and the `issuer` string defined in the capability configuration, as required by [RFC 8414 Section 3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-3.3). No normalization (e.g., trailing slash stripping) is permitted — the comparison **MUST** be an exact string comparison.

Businesses **MUST** ensure the `issuer` string declared in their UCP capability configuration exactly matches both the `issuer` field in their authorization server metadata and the `iss` claim in any issued JWT access tokens. This guarantees that standard JWT validation libraries, which perform exact string equality on `iss`, will succeed without modification.

Failure to validate the issuer exposes the integration to Mix-Up Attacks and **MUST** result in an aborted linking process.

Example metadata retrieved via RFC 8414:

```json
{
    "issuer": "https://auth.merchant.example.com",
    "authorization_endpoint": "https://auth.merchant.example.com/oauth2/authorize",
    "token_endpoint": "https://auth.merchant.example.com/oauth2/token",
    "revocation_endpoint": "https://auth.merchant.example.com/oauth2/revoke",
    "scopes_supported": [
        "dev.ucp.shopping.scopes.checkout_session"
    ],
    "response_types_supported": [
        "code"
    ],
    "grant_types_supported": [
        "authorization_code",
        "refresh_token"
    ]
}
```

#### For platforms

- **MUST** authenticate using their `client_id` and `client_secret` ([RFC 6749 2.3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1)) through HTTP Basic Authentication ([RFC 7617](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617)) when exchanging codes for tokens.
  - **MAY** support Client Metadata
  - **MAY** support Dynamic Client Registration mechanisms to supersede static credential exchange.
- The platform must include the token in the HTTP Authorization header using the Bearer schema (`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`)
- **MUST** implement the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow ([RFC 6749 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)) as the primary linking mechanism.
- **MUST** strictly implement Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) ([RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)) using the `S256` challenge method to prevent authorization code interception attacks.
- **MUST** securely validate the `iss` parameter returned in the authorization response ([RFC 9207](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207.html)) to prevent Mix-Up Attacks.
- **SHOULD** include a unique, unguessable state parameter in the authorization request to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) ([RFC 6749 10.12](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.12)).
- Revocation and security events
  - **SHOULD** call the business's revocation endpoint ([RFC 7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009)) when a user initiates an unlink action on the platform side.
  - **SHOULD** support [OpenID RISC Profile 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-risc-1_0-final.html) to handle asynchronous account updates, unlinking events, and cross-account protection.

#### For businesses

- **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 ([RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749))
- **MUST** adhere to [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) to declare the location of their OAuth 2.0 endpoints (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`)
- **MUST** populate `scopes_supported` in their RFC 8414 metadata to allow platforms to detect scope mismatches early, before initiating the authorization flow.
- **MUST** enforce Client Authentication at the Token Endpoint.
- **MUST** enforce exact string matching for the `redirect_uri` parameter during the authorization request to prevent open redirects and token theft.
- **MUST** enforce Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) ([RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)) validation at the Token Endpoint for all authorization code exchanges.
- **MUST** return the `iss` parameter in the authorization response ([RFC 9207](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207.html)) matching the established issuer string.
- **MUST** provide an account creation flow if the user does not already have an account.
- **MUST** support dynamically requested UCP scopes mapped strictly to the capabilities actively negotiated in the session.
- Revocation and security events
  - **MUST** implement standard Token Revocation as defined in [RFC 7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009).
  - **MUST** revoke the specified token and **SHOULD** recursively revoke all associated tokens.
  - **SHOULD** support [OpenID RISC Profile 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-risc-1_0-final.html) to enable Cross-Account Protection.

## End-to-End Workflow & Example

### Scenario: An AI Shopping Agent (Platform) and a Shopping Merchant (Business)

#### 1. The Merchant's Profile (`/.well-known/ucp`)

The Merchant supports checkout, order management, and secure identity features.

```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout": [{ "version": "2026-03-14", "config": {} }],
  "dev.ucp.shopping.order": [{ "version": "2026-03-14", "config": {} }],
  "dev.ucp.common.identity_linking": [{
    "version": "2026-03-14",
    "config": {
      "supported_mechanisms": [{
        "type": "oauth2",
        "issuer": "https://auth.merchant.example.com"
      }]
    }
  }]
}
```

#### 2. The AI Agent's Profile

The AI Shopping Agent only knows how to perform checkouts. It does NOT yet know how to manage existing orders.

```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout": [{ "version": "2026-03-14" }],
  "dev.ucp.common.identity_linking": [{ "version": "2026-03-14" }]
}
```

#### 3. Execution Steps

1. **Capability Discovery & Intersection**: The AI Agent intersects its own profile with the business's and successfully negotiates `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout` and `dev.ucp.common.identity_linking`. `dev.ucp.shopping.order` is strictly excluded because the agent does not support it.

1. **Schema Fetch & Dynamic Scope Derivation**: The agent fetches the JSON Schema definitions for the **Active Capability List** (`checkout.json` and `identity_linking.json`). The agent parses the schema logic for `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout`, looking for the top-level `"identity_scopes"` annotation, and statically derives that the required scope is strictly `dev.ucp.shopping.scopes.checkout_session`. `dev.ucp.shopping.scopes.order_management` is inherently omitted.

1. **Identity Mechanism Selection & Execution**: The agent applies the Mechanism Selection Algorithm to the business's `supported_mechanisms` array. The first (and only) entry has `type: oauth2`, which the agent supports, so it is selected. The agent executes standard OAuth discovery (appending `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` to the issuer string) and validates that the returned `issuer` is an exact string match to the configured value.

1. **User Consent & Authorization**: The agent generates a consent URL to prompt the user (or invokes the authorization flow directly in the GUI), using the dynamically derived scopes.

   ```http
   GET https://auth.merchant.example.com/oauth2/authorize
     ?response_type=code
     &client_id=shopping_agent_client_123
     &redirect_uri=https://shoppingagent.com/callback
     &scope=dev.ucp.shopping.scopes.checkout_session
     &state=xyz123
     &code_challenge=code_challenge_123
     &code_challenge_method=S256
   ```

   The business will respond with the authorization code and the `iss` parameter per RFC 9207:

   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://shoppingagent.com/callback
     ?code=code123
     &state=xyz123
     &iss=https://auth.merchant.example.com
   ```

   *The user is prompted to consent* *only* *to "Manage Checkout Sessions".*

1. **Authorized UCP Execution**: The platform securely exchanges the authorization code for an `access_token` bound only to checkout and successfully utilizes the UCP REST APIs via `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
