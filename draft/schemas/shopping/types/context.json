  "description": "Provisional buyer signals for relevance and localization: product availability, pricing, currency, tax, shipping, payment methods, and eligibility (e.g., student or affiliation discounts). Businesses SHOULD use these values when authoritative data (e.g., address) is absent, and MAY ignore unsupported values without returning errors. Context SHOULD be non-identifying and can be disclosed progressively—coarse signals early, finer resolution as the session progresses. Higher-resolution data (shipping address, billing address) supersedes context. Platforms SHOULD progressively enhance context throughout the buyer journey.",
