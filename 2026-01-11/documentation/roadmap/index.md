# Roadmap

This roadmap is meant to provide transparency into our strategic priorities and to align our partners on the critical path toward a fully agentic, global commerce standard. Our goal is to move beyond isolated transactions and build a cohesive, intelligent commerce layer that works across borders and verticals.

**Note:** This roadmap reflects our current direction and intends to guide planning, but it does not constitute a commitment to deliver specific features. Our approach to these challenges may evolve, and initiatives are subject to change, removal, or addition as business priorities shift and we receive community feedback.

## Upcoming roadmap priorities

### Deeper support for the full consumer journey

To move beyond isolated transactions, we are expanding the protocol's scope to tackle key user journeys such as multi-item checkout, loyalty, and lifecycle management, while ensuring the business's brand and logic remain central to all shopping experiences. Key upcoming initiatives include:

- **Product discovery and post-order management:** By facilitating the entire journey, we help businesses maximize lifetime and average order value rather than just processing a single item for checkout.
- **Cart and basket building:** Support for multi-item checkout from a business, complex basket rules (e.g., promotions, tax, shipping), and varied fulfillment logic that reflects how people actually shop.
- **Loyalty & Member benefits:** Capabilities to enable loyalty and member benefits to help users find the best value and businesses achieve a deeper connection with their consumers through account linking.
- **Native cross-sell and upsell modules:** Capabilities for businesses to provide personalized recommendations and upsells based on user context.

### Support for global markets

We are building a scalable ecosystem that is inclusive of all business sizes and geographies, ensuring that "simple and open" means accessible to everyone. We plan to do this through a phased rollout across markets, including India, Indonesia, Latin America, and others. We are adapting the protocol to support broader regional use cases and localized payment interoperability.

## Build with us

The future of commerce cannot be built in a vacuum. We invite businesses, developers, and payment providers to join us in refining these specifications. Your feedback on our early builds helps us shape the standards that will power the next generation of global commerce.
