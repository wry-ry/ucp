## Contribution Process

### Significant Changes

Any significant change to the protocol requires a formal
[Enhancement Proposal](../../issues/new?template=enhancement-proposal.md)
and will require Technical Committee approval. Because a change to the protocol
requires the entire adopting ecosystem to implement the change, we consider
significant changes to include:

* Core Schema Modifications: Any change to JSON schemas, including
  adding/updating fields or field descriptions
* Protocol Changes: Alterations to communication flows or expected behaviors of
  operations
* New API Endpoints: Introduction of entirely new capabilities or services.
* Backwards Incompatibility: Any "breaking" change that requires a major version
  increment.

An [Enhancement Proposal](../../issues/new?template=enhancement-proposal.md)
is a living artifact that tracks a proposal through its lifecycle:

* **Proposal:** Anyone can submit; idea is proposed and debated.
* **Provisional:** TC majority vote to accept; enters working draft iteration.
* **Implemented:** TC majority vote to finalize; code complete and merged.

Every [Enhancement Proposal](../../issues/new?template=enhancement-proposal.md)
must follow a standard template requiring sections for a Summary, Motivation,
Detailed Design, Risks, a Test Plan, and Graduation Criteria. This creates a
permanent, public design record for the project's evolution.

### Capability Maturity Levels

After an Enhancement Proposal reaches "Provisional" status, the capability
enters the maturity lifecycle with the following stability guarantees:

#### Working Draft

* **Version:** `Working Draft`
* **Stability:** Breaking changes expected
* **Status:** Prototyping, gathering feedback, iterating on design
* **Exit criteria:** TC majority vote to advance

#### Candidate

* **Version:** `Candidate`
* **Stability:** API surface stable; implementation details may evolve
* **Status:** Early adopter implementations, production pilots
* **Exit criteria:** TC majority vote to advance

#### Stable

* **Version:** `YYYY-MM-DD` (date-based version assigned)
* **Stability:** Full backward compatibility within major version
* **Status:** Production deployments

### Voting and decision making

The path below should be followed for resolving issues that are technical in
nature.

* L1: routine changes (bug fixes, documentation, minor improvements) require
  approval from at least 2 Maintainers.
* L2: Any technical issues that span across topics and/or cannot be resolved
  amongst maintainers and DWGs will be escalated to the TC. Significant changes
  affecting core protocol architecture must follow the Enhancement Proposal
  process, requiring TC approval before implementation.
* L3: Any changes made to the Governance process (e.g updating the
  [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) file) or any changes that impact the core
  protocol’s scope or adoption, must be approved by Governance Council (GC).

The TC reserves the right to stop any discussions deemed non-critical to the
protocol.

### Versioning

The base protocol uses date based versioning. Major version increments (breaking
changes) require a majority Governing Council approval due to the high cost to
the ecosystem. A quorum requires all Governing Council members (or appropriate
representatives) to be present for decision-making. New features should
typically be attempted through the extensions framework first. If an extension
achieves significant usage, it can be considered for adoption into the next
minor version of the core.

### Adding new extensions and capabilities to the core protocol

UCP is designed to be extensible while keeping the core protocol light. A
core principle of UCP is to ensure that the set of extensions and capabilities
defined in UCP have broad ecosystem support. Vendors should first create
capabilities & extensions in vendor-specific namespace pattern
(e.g. com.{vendor}.*) for new use cases. Requests to add new capabilities and
extensions should only be submitted when there is proven widespread adoption of
vendor-specific capabilities and extensions. See
[Spec URL Binding](https://ucp.dev/specification/overview/#spec-url-binding)
and [Governance Model](https://ucp.dev/specification/overview/#governance-model)
for more details on using namespace pattern for creating vendor-specific
capabilities and extensions.

### Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)
for this purpose.

### Pull Request Titles and Commit Messages

This repository enforces **Conventional Commits** for Pull Request titles.
Your PR title must follow this format: `type: description`. If your change
is a breaking change (e.g., removing a schema field or file), you **must**
add `!` before the colon: `type!: description`.

**Common Types:**

* `feat`: A new feature
* `fix`: A bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation only changes
* `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
* `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `perf`: A code change that improves performance
* `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

**Examples:**

* `feat: add new payment gateway`
* `fix: resolve crash on checkout`
* `docs: update setup guide`
* `feat!: remove deprecated buyer field from checkout`

### Linting and Automated Checks

We use linters and automated checks to maintain code quality and consistency.
These checks run automatically via GitHub Actions when you open a pull request.
Your pull request must pass all checks before it can be merged.

You can run many of these checks locally before committing by installing and
using `pre-commit`:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This will set up pre-commit hooks to run automatically when you `git commit`.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes, ensuring you follow the setup instructions below.
3. If you've installed `pre-commit`, it will run checks as you commit.
4. Ensure your pull request title follows the Conventional Commits format.
5. Fill out the pull request template in GitHub, providing details about
    your change.
6. Push your branch to GitHub and open a pull request.
7. Address any automated check failures or reviewer feedback.

## Local Development Setup

### Spec Development

1. Make relevant updates to JSON files in `source/`
2. Run `python generate_schemas.py` to generate updated files in `spec/`
3. Check outputs from step above to ensure deltas are expected. You may need to
   extend `generate_schemas.py` if you are introducing a new generation concept

To validate JSON and YAML files format and references in `spec/`, run
`python validate_specs.py`.

If you change any JSON schemas in `spec/`, you must regenerate any SDK client
libraries that depend on them. For example, to regenerate Python Pydantic
models run `bash sdk/python/generate_models.sh`. Our CI system runs
`scripts/ci_check_models.sh` to verify that models can be generated
successfully from the schemas.

It is also important to go through documentation locally whenever spec files
are updated to ensure there are no broken references or stale/missing contents.

### Documentation Development

1. Ensure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements-docs.txt`
2. Run the development server: `mkdocs serve --watch spec`
3. Open **<http://127.0.0.1:8000>** in your browser
4. Before submitting a pull request with documentation changes, run
    `mkdocs build --strict` to ensure there are no warnings or errors. Our CI
    build uses this command and will fail if warnings are present (e.g.,
    broken links).

### Using a virtual environment (Recommended)

To avoid polluting your global environment, use a virtual environment. Prefix
the virtual environment name with a `.` so the versioning control systems don't
track pip install files:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install virtualenv python3-venv
$ virtualenv .ucp # or python3 -m venv .ucp
$ source .ucp/bin/activate
(.ucp) $ pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
(.ucp) $ mkdocs serve --watch spec
(.ucp) $ deactivate # when done
```
